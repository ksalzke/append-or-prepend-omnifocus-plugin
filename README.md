# Actions

## Append or Prepend

This action can be run on one or more selected tasks. 

It shows a form prompting the user for some text, and a 'prepend' checkbox. 

Then, for each selected task, it appends or prepends the text entered by the user to the original name of the task. By default, the text is appended; if the 'prepend' checkbox is selected, the text is prepended.
